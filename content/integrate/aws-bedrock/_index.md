[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a service that allows you to securely customize foundational models (FMs) with your own data, and to use these models without having to build complex infrastructure management. With Amazon Bedrock, users can access FMs from a variety of vendors through a single API, streamlining the process of creating generative artificial intelligence (AI).

Amazon Bedrock allows you to choose Redis Cloud as the [vector database](https://redis.com/solutions/use-cases/vector-database/) for your knowledge base. After your database is set up and connected to Amazon Bedrock, it will import text data from an Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket into Redis Cloud and use it to extract relevant information when prompted.

For more information about the Redis integration with Amazon Bedrock, see the [Amazon Bedrock integration blog post](https://redis.com/blog/amazon-bedrock-integration-with-redis-enterprise/).

To fully set up Bedrock with Redis Cloud, you will need to do the following:

1. [Set up a Redis Cloud subscription and vector database]({{< relref "/integrate/aws-bedrock/set-up-redis" >}}) for Bedrock.

1. [Create a knowledge base]({{< relref "/integrate/aws-bedrock/create-knowledge-base" >}}) connected to your vector database.

1. [Create an agent]({{< relref "/integrate/aws-bedrock/create-agent" >}}) connected to your knowledge base.
